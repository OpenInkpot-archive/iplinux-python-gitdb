Description: IO of git-style object databases
 GitDB allows you to access bare git repositories for reading and writing. It
 aims at allowing full access to loose objects as well as packs with performance
 and scalability in mind. It operates exclusively on streams, allowing to
 operate on large objects with a small memory footprint.
